# The Odin Calculator

Site live at: https://bugsdev2.github.io/theOdinCalculator/

This is the final project in the foundations course. Building an on-screen calculator is gonna be fun.
One thing I must try to take into account for this project is to work with media queries to make a responsive web app kinda thing.
Another thing that I will try to add is a dark mode toggle button.
Let's see how it all turns out.


REFLETIONS: Basic functionality of the calculator is done. I still cannot for the life of me figure out how to do the 2+2+2 thing. I'm pausing the project here. I'll return to this with a fresh mind later. Have also yet to implement dark mode. As for the responsive design. I'll try implementing that in a future project.


EDIT: (14-06-2023, Wednesday) Added dark mode toggle feature.
