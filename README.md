# The Odin Calculator

Site live at: (Under maintainance)

This is the final project in the foundations course. Building an on-screen calculator is gonna be fun.
One thing I must try to take into account for this project is to work with media queries to make a responsive web app kinda thing.
Another thing that I will try to add is a dark mode toggle button.
Let's see how it all turns out.
